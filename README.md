# JPEG Header Fixer

This Python script modifies the initial headers of a file to match the JPEG image data format. 
It ensures that the file starts with the correct JPEG Start of Image (SOI) marker and optional JFIF APP0 marker.

## Features

- Replaces incorrect or missing JPEG headers.
- Preserve the rest of the file content after correcting the header.
- Can be used to fix files with damaged or missing JPEG headers.

## Requirements

- Python 3. x

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dark-lime-0/jpeg-header-fixer.git
   cd jpeg-header-fixer
   python3 fix_jpeg_header.py your_image_file.jpg
   ```


## Notes
- Please make sure you back up your original file before running the script, as it directly modifies the file.
- This script assumes that the image data after the header is correct. It only fixes the initial header.

## CTF Applications

This script can be a handy tool for fixing image files in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, where damaged or malformed JPEG headers might be part of the puzzle. 
You can use this script to restore such files and gain access to the hidden content within them.

### Real-World Usage

I've successfully used this script in many CTF challenges, especially on platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), where improperly formatted image files are sometimes used as part of the challenge. This tool helps recover valid JPEG images from corrupted files, making it easier to analyze and extract the intended data.

If you're a CTF player or a cybersecurity enthusiast, this script can save you time and effort when dealing with image-based challenges.
